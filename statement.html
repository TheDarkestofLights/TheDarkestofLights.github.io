<h2>my artist statement</h2>
My name is Samantha Pi√±a and I am a multimedia artist. My artistic focus is in sculpture. I work with glass, metal, wood, and ceramic mediums. I have started to work with digital media and  My artwork uses the symbolism used in occultism and the esoteric language in folk magic. I like my art to look like a found object having a semi-finished quality that hides the secrets of its uses. My other influences include archaeological finds and museum objects. Because of these inspirations, I am pursuing an archaeology minor to be closer to the subject. Many of my pieces are a part of a larger body of work to share my broader message. My audience is mainly the practicing occult community as they are often my patrons. I also gain curiosity from onlookers who want to know the hidden meanings in my work, through them is how I dispel falsehoods. I have found that many fear the unknown but they are also immensely curious about it. The main messages of my work is the importance of duality in life. That life is a mystery and we all should want to solve it for a higher calling. I work to tackle the way people let misconceptions influence their reactions. By having the viewer see the art they must come to terms with their prejudice and work to be accepting. My body of work uses the repeated message that we are all connected even though we may be different. Life is a mystery but curiosity is the key to understanding. I am learning about web design and digital media.
